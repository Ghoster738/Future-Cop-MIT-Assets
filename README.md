# Future-Cop-MIT-Assets
The goal of this project is to create Future Cop compatible assets from scratch.

## Why does this exist?
 * While I was working on Future Cop MIT Windows port, I myself got inconvenienced by the project crashing. Eventually, I realized that one of the problems with my project was merely that I did not place my Future Cop files correctly. My program did not tell me this directly, and I thought "would it be nice if my project told the users in the same manor as DevilutionX?" I eventually decided to include embedded font files in my project, so the program would kindly communicate to the user what is wrong. In Windows (and every other GUI operating systems), programs should outright tell what is wrong. To first do this I created font files that are encoded to match format as Future Cop's font files. I used Python 3 to create these font files, and it is was tedious and fun process. I eventually got the embedded font to work with my project.
 * These files can easily be in unit test code of Future Cop MIT as the assets' license of this repository would allow it. 

## Rules
 * The obvious rule of this project is that there are no Future Cop Assets from the original game allowed. **Not even the demos of any version are allowed.**
 * To be extra careful, screenshots containing Future Cop Assets is also not allowed.
 * The files placed there should not have any data from original Future Cop assets.
 * In addition to the above rule, no assets from other intellectual properties are not allowed.
 * Sorry but AI generated art from Stable Diffusion or something similar is not allowed. It is mostly because I do not know if Stable Diffusion infringes on copyright or not. I am likely to change this rule in the future. Fractals like the Mandelbrot Set are fine.
